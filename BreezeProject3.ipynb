    "# Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "Start by introducing the idea of supervised learning and describe what the point of using these models is.\n",
    "You should then discuss the dataset you’ll be using (including where you found it) and the goals/question\n",
    "you want to answer with your supervised learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will used supervised learning to build models in order to predict responses from our dataset. Before we get started let's go over a little bit about what supervised learning is, what we want to do with our models, and briefly discuss the dataset that we will be using throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning  \n",
    "In supervised learning you have a response variable that you are trying to predict. If we fit a predictive model using supervised learning it will be possible to evaluate how well our model predicts the value of our response variable by using observations that were not used in fitting our model.  \n",

    "### Absenteeism At Work Dataset  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we will use contains information about absenteeism at a courier company in Brazil from July 2007 to July 2010. This dataset is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and can be found [here](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/445/absenteeism+at+work). It contains 21 variables that are detailed below:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `ID` - Individual Identification - There are 36 unique employees in the dataset. *This variable will be dropped prior to model building*\n",
    "2.  `Reason for absence` - **Categorical** - This is the recorded reason for the employee's absence. This is a categorical variable with 28 total levels that has been coded numerically. The values 1-21, corresponding to I through XXI, are taken from the World Health Organization's [International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Helth Problems 10 Revision](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2010/en#/). The remaining 7 values of this variable are:  \n",
    "    -  `22` - patient follow-up  \n",
    "    -  `23` - medical consultaion  \n",
    "    -  `24` - blood donation  \n",
    "    -  `25` - laboratory examination  \n",
    "    -  `26` - unjustified absence  \n",
    "    -  `27` - phisiotherapy  \n",
    "    -  `28` - dental consulation  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Note that there are a total of 43 records for which the `Reason for absence` is recorded as `0`. We will simply refer to these as representing a value of `unkonwn` for our `Reason for absence` variable.  \n",
    "3.  `Month of absence` - **Categorical** - This is the month in which the absence is registered.  \n",
    "4.  `Day of the week` - **Categorical** - Work day (Monday through Friday) - Categorical - this is coded numerically with the following values:  \n",
    "    -  `2` - Monday  \n",
    "    -  `3` - Tuesday  \n",
    "    -  `4` - Wednesday  \n",
    "    -  `5` - Thursday  \n",
    "    -  `6` - Friday  \n",
    "5.  `Seasons` - **Categorical** - coded numerically with the following values:  \n",
    "    -  `1` - summer  \n",
    "    -  `2` - autumn  \n",
    "    -  `3` - winter  \n",
    "    -  `4` - spring  \n",
    "6. `Transportation expense` - **Numeric** -  This is the monthly transportation expense of each employee in dollars\n",
    "7. `Distance from Residence to Work` - **Numeric** - This is the distance in kilometers that the employee must travel each day to get to work measured in kilometers.    \n",
    "8. `Service time`  - **Numeric** - the service time of each employee in years.  \n",
    "9.  `Age` - **Numeric** - Age of employee in years.  \n",
    "10. `Work load Average/day` - **Numeric** - This is the average workload per day for the employee, units unknown.  \n",
    "11. `Hit target` - **Numeric** - This is an achievement percentage for periodic goals for each employee.  \n",
    "12. `Disciplinary failure (yes=1; no=0)` - **Categorical** - Binary yes/no about whether the employee recieved a disciplinary warning that month.   \n",
    "13. `Education` - **Categorical/Ordinal** - The highest education level attained by the employee, coded numerically with the following values:  \n",
    "    -  `1` - high school  \n",
    "    -  `2` - graduate  \n",
    "    -  `3` - postgraduate  \n",
    "    -  `4` - master and doctor  \n",
    "14. `Son` - **Numeric** - The total number of children of the employee.  \n",
    "15. `Social drinker` - **Categorical** - This is a binary variable where yes = `1` indicates that the employee is a social drinker and no = `0` indicates that the employee is not a social drinker.  \n",
    "16. `Social smoker`- **Categorical** - This is a binary variable where yes = `1` indicates that the employee is a social smoker and no = `0` indicates that the employee is not a social smoker.    \n",
    "17. `Pet` - **Numeric** - This is the number of pets owned by the employee.  \n",
    "18. `Weight` - ***Numeric** - The employee's weight in kilograms.  \n",
    "19. `Height` - **Numeric** - The employee's height in centimeters.  \n",
    "20. `Body mass index` - **Numeric** - The employee's body mass index. *This variable will be dropped as it is highly correlated with weight and height*   \n",
    "21. `Absenteeism time in hours` - This is our target variable. `Absenteeism time in hours` is a continuous numeric variable representing the number of hours that an employee was absent for a given instance of missed work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling Goals  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in working with this dataset is to build and test multiple models to predict the number of absentee hours (variable 21) for an employee based on a subset of the available variables (1-20) listed above. We will use five different modeling techniques to build, train, and test models based on the absenteeism at work dataset. We will then compare our models to one another to determine which model is the best at predicting our response variable. "

    "The goal of creating our supervised models is to be able to successfully predict the number of absentee hours on new data, that is, on data that was not used to train our model. We want our model to be able to generalize to new data. In order to build a model that will be able to generalize we must be careful to not overfit our model to the data used to build it. If we build a model that is perfect at predicting our response variable based on data that was used to build the model, but largely fails to predict our response variable when new data is used to generate predictions, it is clear to see that our model will not be very useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common way to combat the problem of overfitting our model is to split the data into a training set and a test set. The exact split to use for a training vs test set can vary, but it is common to see an 80/20 or 70/30 training vs test set split. Once the data has been split into training and test sets we can use the training set to fit our model. Often we will want to use model metrics to evaluate the predictions produced by our model based on the observations contained in our training set that were used to fit that model.  \n",

A statistical learning model is a mathematical representation of some phenomenon on which data has been observed and collected. We will built 5 different classes of supervised statistical learning models to predict the value of our response variable, the number of absentee hours. In this section we will briefly discuss the concepts and ideas involved in each of our five classes of models. In the next section, [Model Fitting Using Spark MLlib](#Model-Fitting-Using-Spark-MLlib), we will build and fit our models on the training data set."

    "\n",
    "1.  The `numTrees` parameter - This parameter has a default value of `20` trees. By increasing this value we can bring down the variance in our model as compared to the single regression tree. We will set this value to `100` for our models.  \n",
    "2.  The `featureSubsetStrategy` parameter - This parameter is the number of features to consider for splits at each tree mode.  Possible values for this parameter are:\n",
    "    - `auto` - When this parameter is set to `auto` the number of features will automatically be selected based on the number of trees and the type of model. Our model is a regression model with `100` trees, and as a result `onethird` would be selected automatically. Note that `auto` is the default value for `featureSubsetStrategy`.  \n",
    "    - `all` - Use all features. If this is selected `RandomForestRegressor()` generates a bagged tree model as opposed to a random forest model.   \n",
    "    - `onethird` - The number of features to consider for splits at each tree node will be the total number of features in our model divided by three.  This is usually used for regression problems.  \n",
    "    - `sqrt` - This will use the square root of the number of features for the number of features to consider. This is usually used for classification problems.  \n",
    "    - `log2` - \n",
    "3.  The `maxDepth` parameter - This is the value for the maximum depth of the tree, and can have values ranging from `0` to `30`, with a default value of `5`. The possible values of `maxDepth` that we will use during model selection are `5`, `10`, `15`, `20`, and `25`.  "
